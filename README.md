# rate-my-plate
**Coding Problem:**\
A restaurant keeps a log of (eater_id, foodmenu_id) for all the diners. 
The eater_id is a unique number for every diner and foodmenu_id is unique for every food 
item served on the menu. 
Write a program that reads this log file and returns the top 3 menu items consumed. 
If you find a eater_id with the same foodmenu_id more than once then show an error.

Expected output:
1. Code that can handle the above problem statement\
2. Testcases (with example log files) that checks all the possible conditions\
